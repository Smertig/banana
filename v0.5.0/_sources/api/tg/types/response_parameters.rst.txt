response_parameters_t
=====================

.. cpp:struct:: banana::api::response_parameters_t

   Describes why a request was unsuccessful.

   .. cpp:member:: optional_t<integer_t> migrate_to_chat_id

   Optional. The group has been migrated to a supergroup with the specified identifier. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.

   .. cpp:member:: optional_t<integer_t> retry_after

   Optional. In case of exceeding flood control, the number of seconds left to wait before the request can be repeated
