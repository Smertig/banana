reply_keyboard_remove_t
=======================

.. cpp:struct:: banana::api::reply_keyboard_remove_t

   Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will remove the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard. By default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a bot. An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a button (see ReplyKeyboardMarkup).

   .. cpp:member:: boolean_t remove_keyboard

   Requests clients to remove the custom keyboard (user will not be able to summon this keyboard; if you want to hide the keyboard from sight but keep it accessible, use one_time_keyboard in ReplyKeyboardMarkup)

   .. cpp:member:: optional_t<boolean_t> selective

   Use this parameter if you want to remove the keyboard for specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.Example: A user votes in a poll, bot returns confirmation message in reply to the vote and removes the keyboard for that user, while still showing the keyboard with poll options to users who haven't voted yet.
