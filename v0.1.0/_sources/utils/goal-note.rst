.. note::
   ``banana`` **is not a Telegram Bot Framework but a generic statically typed and highly-configurable thin wrapper over Telegram Bot API**.

   ``banana`` was designed to be both minimalistic and comprehensive at the same time.
   It doesn't provide high-level abstractions or even ``TelegramBot`` class.
   Its main goal is to allow developer to build necessary abstractions on top of the banana API,
   abstracting from the Telegram API implementation.

   You've been warned!
